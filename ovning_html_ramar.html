                    <p2 style="border:2px; border-style:sticky; border-color:rgb(5, 5, 5); padding: 1em;"><p> Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
                        Thou art more <I>lovely</I>and more <strong>temperate.</strong><br>
                        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                        And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sub>date.</sub> <br>
                
                        <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
                        And often is his gold complexion dimmed; <br>
                        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
                        By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed; <br>
                
                        <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st, <br>
                        Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
                            When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.  <br>
                            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, <br>
                            So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. <br></p>
